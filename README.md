# CS-255-Systems-Development-Lifecycle
This repository contains the bulk of the work I completed for the course CS 255 as well as information about the significance of each piece.

During this course, I was tasked with the analysis and design of a web tool called DriverPass.

The hypothetical owners of the product wanted a tool that would allow driving students to schedule in-person dricing lessons, and would also support online tests and modules the progress of which could be viewed on the homepage.

I did a particularly good job of filling in blanks when gathering requirements and putting together features lists. There was a lot that was left unsaid by the owners--as I'm sure happens quite frequently--and I was left to make assumptions about development as the information given to me was from the perspective of someone who does not write code.

If I were to change one thing about the work I submitted, I would include more information about the way that the online tests would work. Most of my diagrams assume that the only time the client would connect to the user database is when they are logging in. Any connection to such a database would require security measures, so I realize after the fact that it is quite necessary to include in diagrams. 

I primarily focused on the users' needs regarding the scheduling aspect of the tool as well as the administrative backend.

It's important to focus on the users' needs during development because at the end of the day that's who the product is for. From a societal standpoint, the product owner and the dev team share the responsiblity of rendering a tool that suits the needs of the intended user. It's important that both parties maintain this priority throughout development so as to not lose track of the purpose of the product.

When I design systems and software, I start by gathering requirements. I then create a detailed outline of the intended user experience. I then comment out detailed pseudocode in the IDE, and then write all of the necessary code while frequently testing. I assume that working with a team would require a lot more diagramming, so if I find myself in such a situation, I imagine that I would try to adhere to that need a bit more than usual.
